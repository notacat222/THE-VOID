    <h2> COPY WRITING and thoughts...</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the depths of my mind... I mean this website. This text will only exist in this void, and in the space between me, sitting in my room writing this on my laptop in VS code, and you.</p>
        <p> Hi Karen Ann or Matilda thanks for visting my little world. </p>
        <p>I am still developing my skills as this is my first website, but I am coming to you from the lense of a cyborg being. I exist in a space trapped between the online meta verse and the physical world where half myself exists in both of these spheres. In my current life, I could not make art, naviagte or communicate without acessing the online meta verse. I exist in whatever form I desire in the online meta verse. I am finnaly free from the binaries of society and here I exist as a cyber grunge cyber feminist cyborg. </p>
        
     <p>  The website uses my face and body as I ask: how much of this website is part of my autonomy? Is the online sphere part of my anatonmy, or perhaps when will it become part of my anatonmy. When we implant technology into ourselves perhaps. Personally, I feel that I already exist as a cyborg, I am reliant on technology, it has metaphysically implanted itself into my brain. So I question, when will my physical self resmble the capabilities of my digital self.</p>
        
     <p>  Another note I question to the void is: How many of the paths in this website depict the exact network paths in my brain? My personal laptop is probably the one item in this world that knows the inner workings of my brain. My history through files or searching, thoughts, apps. It clones my thinking digitally. </p>
        
        <p>In my homepage, my avatar greets the void. Consider this my avatar leaving the void, after all, I have matters in the real world to attend to. </p>

     <p>   Thank you for reading.</p>
