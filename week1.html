    <h2>Week 1:</h2>

        <p> This week we looked at gesture and the basics of HTML. We created an alarm clock that requires the user to complete star jumps in order to turn the alarm off.</p>
        <p> Here are some case studies and research I found interesting.</p>

        <p>Case Study One: Various Notes from `Computers as Theater,' By Brenda Laurel
            <br>
            - Interface as a common ground and contact zone. A shared context for action in which the computer and the human are both agents
        </br>
        <br>
- The interface as the arena for the performance of some task, the process of interaction 
    </br>
    <br>
- Graphic design representations are fundamental to both the physical and emotional aspects of directness in interaction. The role of the graphic designer in human computer interaction is parallel to the role fo the theatrical scene designer. Both create representations of objects and environments that provide a context for action.
</br> 
- The experience of interactivity is a “thresholdly” phenomenon, and it is also highly context-dependent. The search for a definition of interactivity diverts our attention from the real issue: How can humans participate as agents within representational contexts?
<br>
- Even in task-oriented applications, there is more to the experience than getting something done in the real world, and this is the heart of the dramatic theory of human-computer interaction. Our focus is not primarily on how to accomplish real-world objectives, but rather how to accomplish them in a way that is both pleasing and amenable to artistic formulation; that is, in a way in which the designer may shape a person’s experience so that it is enjoyable, invigorating, and whole
</br>
<br>
- The proper object of interaction design is what the interactor is doing and experiencing—the action. Thinking about things this way automatically avoids the trap doors into meta-level transactions with “the system.”
</br>
<br>
- Thinking about interfaces is thinking too small. Designing human-computer experience isn’t about building a better desktop. It’s about creating imaginary worlds that have a special relationship to reality: worlds in which we can extend, amplify, and enrich our own capacities to think, feel, and act.

        <p>Case Study Two: Fluxus Art Movement </p>
        <p>Fluxus was a neo-dadist group pf artists from the 1960s. The key characteristics of the group was globalism, unity of art and life, intermedia, experimentalism, chance, playfulness, simplicity, implicitness, exemplativism and presence in time. Included experimental electronic artists such as Nam June Paik who was a pioneer in video art and utilising CRT monitors. The group highlighted the importance of artistic process over the finished product and a reject of traditional art world norms.</p>
