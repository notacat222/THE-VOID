    <p>During this course of learning PJ5, I began to think about the inner systems of computers, that is the nodes and networks that build together to create a large system. I wanted to explore how with computers, this is often binary and built with equations and alogrithms. I began developing parametric equations to explore how to potentially visiualise some of these mathmatical computer systems and possibly explore illustrating the inner workings of the computer's 'brain'. I am exploring what is happening BEHIND the interface, visualising internal systems. </p>
