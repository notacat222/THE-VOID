    <p>This sketch demonstrates these qualities to me. A never-ending interweaving of systems that collapse in on eachother and rely on eachother to form a complete shape. I am exploring the codependence of systems and alogrithms, and the beauty data visualisation can have. In the bigger picture I correlate this to something like the food chain. A never ending, forever repeating nodal network where every agent relies on another agent in an interconnected system. I correlate the innner workings of a computer to ecological systems and networks, like the food chain or a brain network. A parametric visualisation of this is just the beginning and perhaps all my humble coding skills will allow for at this stage.

    <p>The flow of this website also depicts this as I transfer you from one page to the next. PAGE -> PAGE -> PAGE: everything relies on what is before and what is next.</p>
