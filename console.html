        console.log("Here I write my final thoughts for this Workbook...And so, everything is connected. And because everything is connected, everything becomes interactive as we all act as independent agents in the web of our realities. As my cyborg being grows and learns more about the void and reality, I see paralells and attempt to construct the inner workings of my mind in this website. I have used the parametric equation as a metaphor for 1 system. 1 way of exploring how to visualise interconnectedness. 1 way to depict how an inner working in the universe operates. Math as a way to truth seek, as an experimental uncovering of what lies beneath the surface. And a reminder that everything is composed of everything. Creative coding as a way to explore the possibilies of expression of these systems, highlighting the inner workings of my computer and therefore my brain.");
