                <p>The manifesto is extremely inspiring for me as it utilizes the online space for disruption and to question the boundaries of existence.</p>
                <p>The ability to create avatars, reinvent yourself and be unbound in a space that has no boundaries. Utilizing the binaries of 1 and 0 to prove that despite these restrictions, experimental existence can happen. Despite a 1 and a 0, you can be in-between released of binaries in the real world and reinvent yourself in the void and with the void. The approach of being a virus, aimed to dismantle and re-build in an inherently decolonial and anti-patriarchal lense.</p>

                <p>The interface becomes a liminal space, accessing a chance for transformation of self through an addition of reality in the form of a digital avatar. Digital technology changes the concept of liminal space, as data is transformed from one state to another. As human witness, an Intergration of human and the machine causes a second wave of metaphysical liminal space. </p>
                <p>The digital sphere empowers one to morph identity. To be perceived as half the self-amongst a void of chaotic over consumption, a feeling of loneliness in a space (online or physical) full of people.</p>
                <p> “Liminal space created as part of a digital transformation provides a moment of slippage, a space where we are poised on a threshold between one reality and another. A place where chance is introduced and the outcome is unknown. This is informed by the process of making the works.” “the digital revolution has entered a phase of deep Intergration of the human and the machine” </p>

                <p>"Considering both the metaphor of the algorithm and the archive as an architecture to decolonize and reword while simultaneously creating dynamic interventions that disrupt the status quo and hold a black mirror of now up to the electric mirrors that line the dawning halls of time-based media. Glitch art can often be seen as focusing on the failure that can occur within the digital realm, a comparison that allows us to see clearly how technological advances have produced radical changes in the physical, spatial and mobile nature of the artwork."</p>
                  <p>It appears as a kinetic art that becomes critical through error, mimicking the real-time movement that contemporary culture demands, and concern over the artificiality of images that mimic reality as if to replace it.  It has a unique aesthetic of a digital age, almost playing on internet nostalgia and targeting new media artists. It is easily recognisable to the up and coming generation having grown up in the dawn of the digital age. </p>
                  <p>“The glitch is a hidden door to a secret world… a world of pure, abstract noise that exists beneath the surface of the digital realm.” – Antonio Roberts, Glitch Artist. </p>
                  <p>`Glitch’ as an artistic concept was also popularised by artist Legacy Russell, in her manifesto Glitch Feminism. Here, Russell discusses how glitch is celebrated as a vehicle of refusal, a strategy of non-performance. She applies this to feminism, looking at `glitch as error,’ acknowledging that gendered bodies are far from absolute but rather an imaginary, manufactured and commodified for capital. The glitch is an activist prayer, a call to action, breaking free of an understanding of gender as something stationary. As we question how the merging of the digital and physical world affects us, glitch art and the concept of error as refusal can minimise the affect of digitisation on our art and bodies, utilising the glitch as a tool to express inherent error and protest against binary systems. Glitch art can be used to question the power of digitisation, as we loose our data sovereignty and control over our personal information, the concept of a glitch in the system, reminds us that even the digital world has flaws. The act of refusal to work, a malfunction, a virus innately copies human refusal causing a reaction of change, to move, and therefore an alternate perspective and course due to an innate malfunction. It prompts us to look beneath the surface, and uncover raw imperfections that exist beneath binary structures.</p> </td>

              <td>A Cyborg Manifesto, Donna J. Harroway</td>
              <td><p>"Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments: first, the production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now; and the second, taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means, embracing the skilful task of reconstructing the boundaries of daily life, impartial connections with others, in communication with all of our parts. Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our told to ourselves. It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Through both are bound in the spiral dance."</p>
                <p> Lately I've also been thinking about how the cybrog as a concept lies in the defintion of an interconnencted human, that is, in the ecosystem or electronic networks. A human becomes a cyborg through the post-human realisation that they are simply an actor in the system. I love this image below (`The Creation of Adam'), included in a lecture by Donna Harroway (linked below) as it plays on a few notions: 1, what came first the chicken or the egg, but in terms of creation of the web. 2. empowers the human in the context of computers and technology being viewed as a God. </p>

                <p> Actor network theory: theory that everything exists in constantly shifting networks of relationships. Actors have agency and agency allows things to be affected. </p>
                
               <p>"In “When Species Meet” Donna Haraway delves deeper into the mortal world-making entanglements that she calls contact zones, working with world-building figures. Here, figures are not regarded as mere representations or illustrations but rather nodes or knots in which diverse bodies and meanings co-shape one another. Haraways earlier writing is filled with powerful figures such as cyborgs, monkeys, mice and dogs, and in every case they are speculative creatures of imagined possibility and at the same time of ordinary reality. Just as the contact zone (interface) only comes into being when energy is directed into and through it, Haraway notes similar tendencies for her figures: 
                
                The partners do not precede the meeting; species of all kinds, living and not, are consequent on a subject - and object - shaping dance of encounters."</p>

                <p>This text particulalry speaks to me as it compares ecological interconnectedness with the digital networks of interconenctedness. It correlates how there are two paralell worlds in this sense, the physical and the digital that are acting in similar ways, that is, built on systems and networks the interfer and affect eachother. I love the way this text discusses the power of the interface as a meeting point and conctact zone, where the human agent can make change to the digital agent. You could say the interface is a powerful liminal space where spieices meet.</p>
                
               <p>" Worlding or world-building is blending the material and semiotic, that removes the boundaries between subject and environment. In a new materialist manner it is important to note that world building is not an exclusively human ability or process. Worlding can be described as an active, ontological process, not simply a result of our existence in our passive encounter with particular environments, circumstances, events or places. World building practices form through the turning of attention to a certain experience, place or encounter and simultaneously the active engagement with the materiality and context in which events and interactions occur. The above mentioned new materialist practices enable us to look at human-world entanglements  more closely and inspect how our immediate encounters connect to and intersect with the wider (non-human) world. Donna Haraway’s practice is underpinned through myriad different worldings and their companion species relation." </p>

              <td>Computers as Theater, Brenda Laurel</td>
              <td><p>"When we participate as agents, the shape of the whole action becomes available to us in new ways. We experience it, not only as observers or critics, but also as co-makers and participants. Systems that incorporate this sensibility into their basic structure, open up to us a cornucopia of dramatic pleasures. This is the stuff of dream and desire; of life going right. It is the vision that fuels our love affair with art, computers, and any other means that can enhance and transform our experience."</p>

                <p>"This confusion over the nature of human-computer activity can be alleviated by thinking about it in terms of theatre, where the special relationship between representation and reality is already comfortably established, not only in theoretical terms, but also in the way that people design and experience theatrical works. Both domains employ representations as contexts for thought. Both attempt to amplify and orchestrate experience. Both have the capacity to represent actions and situations that typically do not and cannot exist in the real world, in ways that invite us to extend our minds, feelings, and senses to envelop them." </p>

                <p>"The proper object of interaction design is what the interactor is doing and experiencing—the action. Thinking about things this way automatically avoids the trap doors into meta-level transactions with “the system.” Constraining how or whether people can introduce new potential into a dramatic interaction is essential in the creation and maintenance of dramatic probability.  Thinking about interfaces is thinking too small. Designing human-computer experience isn’t about building a better desktop. It’s about creating imaginary worlds that have a special relationship to reality: worlds in which we can extend, amplify, and enrich our own capacities to think, feel, and act." </p>

                <p>This text has felt like a God Send. I come from a background of theater, and the text discusses the employment of dramatic potential into the interface, AKA the computer as theater. It has been facinating to read about the true dramatic potential of HCI, and has helped me employ interactive elements into this website as I think about dramatic foundations such as character, plot, setting and atmosphere.</p>
